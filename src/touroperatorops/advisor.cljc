(ns touroperatorops.advisor
  "TourOperatorOpsAdvisor -- the *contained intelligence node* for the
  ISIC-7912 tour-operator operations-coordination actor.

  It drafts exactly four kinds of back-office proposal from a closed
  allowlist: tour-record logging (itinerary / participant-manifest /
  excursion data), tour-operation scheduling (itinerary / guide /
  vendor), local-vendor/guide settlement coordination, and
  traveler-safety-concern flagging. CRITICAL: it is a
  smart-but-untrusted advisor. It returns a *proposal* (with a
  rationale + the fields it cited), never a committed record and NEVER
  a direct actuation -- every proposal's `:effect` is always
  `:propose`. Every output is censored downstream by
  `touroperatorops.governor` before anything touches the SSoT.

  This advisor NEVER drafts a direct finalization of a
  traveler-safety-clearance decision, a direct resumption/go-ahead
  order for a held excursion, or an override of a traveler-safety
  authority's decision -- those are permanently out of scope for this
  actor, not merely un-implemented (Wave 4 person-facing-service
  safety guardrail, ADR-2607152500).
  `touroperatorops.governor`'s `scope-exclusion-violations`
  independently re-scans every proposal for exactly this failure mode
  (a compromised or confused advisor drifting into scope it must never
  touch) and HARD-holds it, regardless of confidence or op.

  Like every sibling actor's advisor, this is a deterministic mock so
  the actor graph runs offline and the governor contract is exercised
  end-to-end. In production this calls a real LLM (kotoba-llm or
  equivalent) with the same proposal shape.

  Proposal shape (all kinds):
    {:op         kw             ; echoes the request op
     :tour-id    str
     :summary    str            ; human-facing draft / finding
     :rationale  str            ; why -- SCANNED by the scope-exclusion gate
     :cites      [str ..]       ; facts/sources the advisor used -- SCANNED too
     :effect     :propose       ; ALWAYS :propose -- never a direct actuation
     :value      map            ; the draft payload a human/system would review
     :confidence 0..1}")
