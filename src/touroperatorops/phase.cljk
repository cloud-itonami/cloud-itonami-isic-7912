  "Phase 0->3 staged rollout for the ISIC-7912 tour-operator
  operations-coordination actor.

    Phase 0  read-only            -- no writes, still governor-gated.
    Phase 1  assisted-logging     -- tour-record logging allowed,
                                      every write needs human approval.
    Phase 2  assisted-coordination-- adds tour-operation scheduling
                                      and vendor-settlement
                                      coordination, still approval.
    Phase 3  supervised auto      -- governor-clean, high-confidence
                                      `:log-tour-record`/
                                      `:schedule-tour-operation`/
                                      `:coordinate-vendor-settlement`
                                      may auto-commit.
                                      `:flag-traveler-safety-concern`
                                      NEVER auto-commits, at any phase.

  `:flag-traveler-safety-concern` is deliberately ABSENT from every
  phase's `:auto` set, including phase 3 -- a permanent structural
  fact, not a rollout milestone still to come (Wave 4
  person-facing-service safety guardrail, ADR-2607152500). Flagging a
  traveler-safety concern always needs a human to actually look at it.
  `touroperatorops.governor`'s own `always-escalate-ops` enforces the
  same invariant independently -- two layers, not one, agree on this."
